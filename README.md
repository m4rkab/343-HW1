Homework 1 for CIS 343

Some commands I will commonly use in GitHub are:

  git init, which creates a git repository in a folder on the machine.
  
  git commit -m "message" which creates a commit, consisting of changes to the repository.
  
  git checkout -b mybranch which creates a branch called mybranch (replace with actual name). This is an alternate state of the project where changes can be made without affecting the already-existing project.
  
  git push origin mybranch which pushes the branch mybranch to GitHub and thus can move changes from your computer to the repository on GitHub.
